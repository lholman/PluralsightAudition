### The problem
All too frequently I have observed that automation code and "processes" are a combination of very complex, unversioned locally saved code and dependencies. Delving deeper these important scripts are often rats nests of 100's or even 1000's of lines of logic, they're brittle, one change can break them or even worse give a non-deterministic output. Rarely do they implement consistent patterns for error handling, retry, auditing or security and idempotency is often not understood.
