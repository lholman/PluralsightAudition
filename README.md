## Introduction
30 seconds to tease about what I'll be teaching

In this module you will learn how to build quality automation scripts and code in Powershell. You will become familiar with the Pester test Framwework for PowerShell and understand how to version and package infrastructure code.

## Audition module 'Sharing PowerShell infrastructure code'
* Sharing PowerShell infrastructure code
	* Overview (1m) 
		"We already use source control to track change, now we would like to run our tests every time a change is made to source control, and be able to see historically the success of those tests over time."
	* Running pester tests on a build server (3m)
		* TeamCity
		* Jenkins
		* TravisCI
		* VS Git with TFS express
	* Versioning scripts (2m)
	* Packaging scripts (2m)

### The problem
Automation code is often a combination of very complex, locally saved, unversioned code that requires a lot of knowledge to execute. Delving deeper these important scripts are often rats nests of 100's or even 1000's of lines of logic, they're brittle, one change can break them or even worse give a non-deterministic output.
